example-location-page-generator.py — a WORKED EXAMPLE, not a drop-in tool.

This is the actual script used to generate all 7 Phase-1 location pages
for the Savannah Tree Removal Co site (2026-09-08/09), lightly
genericized (brand name/domain/phone/email pulled into a CONFIG block
at the top) so it's a realistic starting point for the *next* microsite
build rather than something tied to this one project.

Why a generator script at all, instead of hand-writing each page: the
skill's own "Stack and hosting" section sanctions this explicitly — HTML
structure repeats across location pages (nav, footer, section order,
schema shape), so writing it once as a template and looping over
per-location DATA keeps that structure consistent while forcing the
actual CONTENT (the `facts` field per location) to be genuinely
different per page. The output is still plain static HTML — nothing
runs at request time, this is purely an authoring convenience.

HOW TO ADAPT THIS FOR A NEW PROJECT:
1. Do the location research FIRST (see SKILL.md "Location-page research
   workflow") — you need real facts in hand before touching this file.
2. Copy this file into the new project's scratchpad (not into the new
   project's own repo — this stays a skill reference, not project code).
3. Edit the CONFIG block below for the new brand/domain/phone/email/
   service list/favicon monogram.
4. Replace the LOCATIONS list with the new project's own researched
   locations — the shape (slug/name/zip/meta_desc/lede/facts/
   note_title/note_body/badges/faq) is the contract, keep it, change
   the *content*.
5. Copy the HEAD_TEMPLATE's nav/header/footer HTML out of one of the new
   project's already-built pages (service pages are usually built
   first) so paths and boilerplate match exactly — don't hand-retype it,
   copy-paste it to avoid transcription bugs.
6. Run it, then IMMEDIATELY run check_broken_links.py and
   check_faq_schema.py (see SKILL.md) before considering the batch done.

The LOCATIONS data below is kept as the real Savannah example (not
replaced with foo/bar placeholders) because the *level of research*
each entry represents — a real, sourced, specific fact per location,
not a template with the city name swapped — is the actual point being
demonstrated. See SKILL.md for where each of these facts came from.
